## Lazarus - Toggle Display Affinity

Adds a "Toggle Display Affinity" option in the **View** menu that allows to prevent taking a screenshot of the IDE window.

Thanks [@n7800](https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,70891.msg552920.html#msg552920) for putting this into an installation package.
